# VILAB Personal Webpage Template

## Download and Installation

This website is created using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).  You can either install bootstrap and
move the elements in this template accross or just fork / copy this repo.

## Usage

* Although this is a "template", please just edit the HTML directly after
  installing / copying.
* Include links to projects.  Each project may have more than one particiant, so
  you will have to sort out the ownership between the participants.
* Papers and their code can be included.  However, it may just be better to just
  include links to Google Scholar / UoB Pure
* The basics of this template are related to bootstrap.  Description of the grid pattern its
  associated formatting tags can be found on the
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) webpage.
* You should possibly add some meta tags for social media.  Examples are
  included but have been commented out.
* There are many more acedmicons available (the link icons at the top); such as
  twitter, instagram etc., see [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)

## Issues

* You should check what your page looks like on mobile devices.  The template
  has been checked for the content that has currently been created, but yours
may not display well and you should check.
* The shape and size of mobile presentation has been normalised using "normalize.min.css".  This may not be what you want to edit as required.
* This is also true of resized windows on any device.  The developed websites
  have looked fine up to that point.
